              Jose Torres impressed me with his ability to understand a
              position, articulate this back, and then provide boundless energy
              and drive to achieve a positive outcome. Jose has an infectious
              energy and can quickly integrate himself into the team, an
              attribute that should never be underestimated. He is also
              supportive and a great person to have in your corner.
            </p>

              Jose and I have worked in corresponding roles for a few years. He
              excels in adapting to change, has shown his hard work through his
              dedication to his role and is a team player who looks out for
              everyone's success. His positive out look with added humor into
              his team dynamic is an asset to any team.
            </p>

            <p>
              I met Jose at his actual job. His professionalism, dedication,
              politeness, and willingness to go above and beyond at what he
              does, really impressed me. Jose makes sure he gives 100% (or more)
              on everything he does. He has to know that when a client leaves
              his store, the client is completely satisfied with the outcome of
              the purchase or situation. I have also seen some of the work Jose
              has done thru the classes he's taking at SMU and it's just
              amazing. It doesn't surprise me because I know that he puts his
              heart into anything he decides to do. I highly recommend Jose for
              anything he decides to do. You will be impressed, just like I was
              when I first met him.

          <div>
            <p>
              I was thoroughly impressed by Jose’s performance in the Web
              Development boot camp he took through SMU. Not only was he able to
              master the tech skills in a short period of time, but he remained
              dedicated, committed, and showed a positive “can-do” attitude
              throughout the course. Learning to code isn’t about memorizing
              syntax and copy/pasting code snippets. It’s about being adaptable
              enough to change your mentality and learn something new and Jose
              was able to do exactly that. He’s hard-working, passionate, and
              sharp as a tac and I can’t recommend him enough.
