            Jose Torres impressed me with his ability to understand a
            position, articulate this back, and then provide boundless energy
            and drive to achieve a positive outcome. Jose has an infectious
            energy and can quickly integrate himself into the team, an
            attribute that should never be underestimated. He is also
            supportive and a great person to have in your corner.

            Jose and I have worked in corresponding roles for a few years. He
            excels in adapting to change, has shown his hard work through his
            dedication to his role and is a team player who looks out for
            everyone's success. His positive out look with added humor into
            his team dynamic is an asset to any team.

            Jose and I worked closely together during our preparation as Full Stack Web Developers. Very knowledgeable
            and resourceful in his affinity with Front-end coding. Completely determined to get the job done, he's
            proven valuable in group projects countless times. His attention to the details have made all the difference
            when designing a Web Page. A social disposition and willingness to learn make Jose a great asset in whatever
            endeavor he puts his mind to.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was thoroughly impressed by Jose’s performance in the Web
            Development boot camp he took through SMU. Not only was he able to
            master the tech skills in a short period of time, but he remained
            dedicated, committed, and showed a positive “can-do” attitude
            throughout the course. Learning to code isn’t about memorizing
            syntax and copy/pasting code snippets. It’s about being adaptable
            enough to change your mentality and learn something new and Jose
            was able to do exactly that. He’s hard-working, passionate, and
            sharp as a tac and I can’t recommend him enough.
